# 🌐 Tailscale: Host Networking & Remote Access

## Architectural Placement

> [!NOTE]  
> Tailscale is NOT deployed inside an LXC or VM. It is installed directly on the bare-metal Proxmox hypervisor (Debian OS).

**Engineering Rationale:**
- **Management Access:** Guarantees remote access to the Proxmox Web GUI (Port 8006) even if the internal virtual network fails.
- **Subnet Router Capability:** Acts as a gateway to expose the internal 192.168.1.x subnet to authenticated remote devices.

## The MagicDNS Conflict

> [!WARNING]  
> By default, Tailscale's MagicDNS overrides the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` to use `100.100.100.100`. On a bare-metal hypervisor without a dedicated DNS manager like `systemd-resolved`, this breaks outbound domain resolution for the host, causing critical operations (like fetching Proxmox community scripts) to fail with "Temporary failure in name resolution".

## The Permanent Engineering Fix

To force Tailscale to relinquish DNS control while maintaining the VPN mesh network, the following commands were executed on the Proxmox Node Shell:

```bash
# 1. Instruct Tailscale to stop modifying host DNS
tailscale set --accept-dns=false

# 2. Hardcode reliable upstream DNS for the Proxmox host
echo -e "nameserver 1.1.1.1\nnameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Conclusion:**  
This fix ensures the hypervisor can reliably reach the internet and download packages independently of the lab's internal DNS containers.
